# SerGIS Game Engine

The Node.js-based server for running and creating SerGIS-based games.

## Pre-reqs

The server must have a recent version of [node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/) (usually installed with node.js).

SerGIS Game Engine has a few node.js dependencies; to install these, run `npm install` in a terminal in the root directory of the codebase.
